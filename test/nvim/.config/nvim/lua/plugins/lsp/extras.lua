-- lua/plugins/lsp/extras.lua
--
-- LSP-adjacent utilities that enhance specific workflows.
--
-- lazydev.nvim
--   Dynamically configures lua_ls workspace libraries for Neovim config files.
--   Replaces the static workspace.library approach. Only loads on lua filetypes.
--   Has a blink.cmp integration (see completion.lua for the "lazydev" source).
--   NOTE: do not set workspace.library in after/lsp/lua_ls.lua — lazydev owns it.
--
-- nvim-lsp-file-operations
--   Sends workspace/willRenameFiles and workspace/didRenameFiles LSP notifications
--   when files are moved or renamed. This is what causes ts_ls to update imports.
--   Neovim core has no equivalent — vim.lsp.util.rename renames the file but
--   does not notify the server about imports.
--   Works with: oil.nvim, neo-tree, nvim-tree, triptych.
